# Overview

This is my first Java project that I have created. I have knowledge in other coding languages like C# and python.

I wanted to create a simple but realistic project to start learning how Java sytax works. I work in outbound phone sales. We get a list of leads and they need to be homes in order for us to help. I created a list scrubbing program that will remove all of the addresses that have an apt in them. It will then create two lists one with all the appartments and one with all the other addresses.

The purpose for writing this was to create a simple skeleton for list scrubbing. It can be easily modified to fit any application of remove specfic items from lists once you undersand how all the functions work.
